# RSpec exercise 1: simple specs (directory `ttt`)

This directory contains a cleaned-up and slightly more idiomatic (in
some ways) version of the TicTacToe game from `ch02-saas` directory.
Running `bundle` will set you up to use `autotest`, keeping it running
the whole time as specs are added.

Suggested use: 

0. Print out the contents of `tic_tac_toe_spec.rb` for your reference
0. Switch to a scratch branch, and gut all the specs by
eliminating the `do` blocks and the `describes`, so that only "bare"
`it` clauses remain.  Or even better, start building up the `it` clauses
one by one.
0. Ask students to pair up and write each spec, then go over the spec
together.  
  * After the "new game" specs, point out the opportunity to pull
out `@game = TicTacToe.new('o')` into a `before(:each)` block, but point
out that we must then use an instance variable `@game` rather than a
local variable, so that the instance variable's value is visible to the
various cases.  Advanced students may be curious to know what type of
object it's an instance variable of; the answer is that it's an instance
variable of `Rspec::ExampleGroup`, the class that represents a group of
examples.  Recall that unlike Java, a class in Ruby does not predefine
the set of allowed instance variables; any instance of the class can
create its own instance variables without permission.
  * When doing the specs for exceptions, ask why the argument to
  `expect` must be in curly braces rather than parentheses. (The answer
  is that the curly braces make the argument a procedure, and when
  `expect` receives a procedure argument, it calls the procedure and
  catches any exceptions.  This allows us to write specs that test
  whether an exception was in fact raised.)

0. When creating the specs "verifies that board is full" and "indicates
NO win if board is full", again point out that the code to "fill the
board" with a non-winning game can be pulled out into a before-block,
as long as we isolate the cases that depend on that code as their own
example group.  We can do this with either a nested `describe` or with
`context`, which is just a synonym for `describe`.
  * Discussion question: why is it so complex to setup this
  precondition?  (Answer: Our tictactoe abstraction doesn't expose the
  board as a writable element.  We could choose to do that and then
  simply have a before-block that sets the board; that would be a
  glass-box test.  But that increases the risk that someone using the
  class externally can write the board.  Whether that's a reasonable
  risk is a matter of judgment.  
  * There are two Ruby tricks we could use to do this behind the code's
  back.  One is `@game.instance_variable_set(:@board, %w(o x o o x o x o
  x))`, which reaches directly into a class to set an instance
  variable.  Clearly, this shouldn't ever be done in real code.
  * The other is to reopen the class and declare a setter for the board,
  so the before block can just say `@game.board = %w(o x o o x o x x x)`:
```
class TicTacToe
  attr_writer :board
end
```


* After doing all the specs, get the students to answer this question:
what's the ratio of lines of tests to lines of code?  (They can use `wc
-l` to answer it if they have Unix command-line skills.)  How does this
compare to test-to-code ratios in industry?  (There is large variation, but
ranges of 2:1 to 10:1 are not uncommon.)

# RSpec exercise #2: rspec-rails (directory `rottenpotatoes-rails-intro`)

This subdirectory contains a copy of the starter code for the ["Enhancing
RottenPotatoes"
homework](https://github.com/saasbook/hw-rottenpotatoes-rails-intro) to
illustrate what additional RSpec functionality is provided by the
`rspec-rails` gem to help specifically with the testing of Rails apps.

An important message here is that these are simply extensions to the
core RSpec framework that understand the inner workings of Rails.  For
example:

* rspec-rails defines methods `get`, `put`, `post`, etc. (HTTP verbs),
which take an action name and optional `:params => { }` argument to
cause the right controller action to be called with parameters,
bypassing the routing system that maps URLs and parses `params` from
them.  This allows controller methods to be tested separately from the
routing, so controller specs do not break if routing changes.

* rspec-rails "knows" that all controller actions must either redirect
or render something.  To avoid having controller specs depend on whether
the redirect or render happens successfully, `rspec-rails` defines the
matchers `redirect_to` and `render_template`.
